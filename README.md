# Soccer Business Location Analysis 
**Identifying ideal areas in So. Cal to open an indoor soccer business**

This project was undertaken to provide a family member with practical insight on ideal locations to consider as he pursues opening an indoor soccer arena in Southern California. It presents data on average building rents, soccer activity levels, and relevant census demographics for all cities in LA & Orange counties. All data is contained in several maps created with Mapbox and can be found on my **[website](https://hassenmorad.github.io/soccer.html)**.
